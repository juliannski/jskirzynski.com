abstract: Our work focuses on automatic extraction of planning strategies used by people in decision-making experiments. The method we introduce uses clustering to identify similar behaviors, and then imitation learning approach from our <a href="\publication\ai_interpret\" target="_blank">previous work</a> to describe those behaviors. Our tests indicate this method discovers over 50% strategies found by people 6 times faster, and could save a lot of valuable research time.

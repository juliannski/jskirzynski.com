abstract: abstract: When making decisions, people often overlook critical information or are overly swayed by irrelevant information. We propose that recently developed reinforcement learning methods for discovering clever heuristics for good decision-making can be partially leveraged to assist human experts designing effective decision-aids. In this paper we show and test a general method for transforming idiosyncratic policies into simple and interpretable descriptions.


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We present an imitation learning method for generating an intepretable description of any RL policy in form of a decision tree. We also apply that method in our pipeline for strategy discovery and show how people's decision making improves when they use the decision trees.

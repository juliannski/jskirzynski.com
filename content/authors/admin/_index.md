I am a Ph.D student in Computer Science at UCSD where I work with {{< staticref "https://www.berkustun.com" "newtab" >}}Berk Ustun{{< /staticref >}}. My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, cognitive science and human-computer interaction. I am broadly interested in integrating these areas to improve human decision-making. I would like to create methods that identify parts of the input space where machine learning models outperform humans, extract interpretable strategies from models, and design and empirically evaluate interventions that use these strategies to improve decision-making.

Previously, I was a research scientist at the Max Plank Institute where I worked with {{< staticref "https://sites.google.com/site/falklieder/home" "newtab" >}}Falk Lieder{{< /staticref >}} on interpretable reinforcement learning and on interventions to improve human planning. I also advised {{<staticref "https://miamienglishgame.com" "newtab" >}}Educational Entertainment One{{</staticref >}} – a Polish company that developed mobile games for English language learning. I obtained M.S. in Computer Science from McGill University, M.S. in Cognitive Science from University of Warsaw, and B.S. in Mathematics and Cognitive Science from University of Warsaw. You can access my full {{< staticref "uploads/CV.pdf" "newtab" >}}CV here{{< /staticref >}}.

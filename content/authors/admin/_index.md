I am a Computer Science PhD student at UCSD working with {{< staticref "https://www.berkustun.com" "newtab" >}}Berk Ustun{{< /staticref >}} and closely collaborating with {{< staticref "https://sites.google.com/site/falklieder/home" "newtab" >}}Falk Lieder{{< /staticref >}} from the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems. My research interests concern machine learning, interpretability, human-computational cognitive science, and reinforcement learning. I am mostly motivated by the use of artificial intelligence in improving human decision making. 

I also advise AI design and production at {{<staticref "https://miamienglishgame.com" "newtab" >}}Educational Entertainment One{{</staticref >}} – a company that is developing the first-ever narrative-driven mobile game for learning English.

Previously, I studied Mathematics and Cognitive Science at University of Warsaw, and Computer Science at McGill University. You can access my full {{< staticref "uploads/CV.pdf" "newtab" >}}CV here{{< /staticref >}}.
